The number of cells per dimension equals 4.

The number of cells in total equals 256.

The resolution of each cell is 1.

The cell occupancy (coverage metric) is 100%.

The time spent for trace generation is 1012.80973.

The time spent for training is 170.39783.



The STL property for the NN is (alw_[0,sim_time] (((abs(In1[t+dt]-In1[t])>d) or ([t]==0)) => (ev_[0,3.5] (alw_[0,1.5] ((abs(y_nn[t]-In1[t])<e)))))) and ((abs(y_nn[t]-y[t])<0.2)).

The falsification/retraining loop was executed 3 times.

Iteration 1.

----------------------

 The falsification time was 1841.25701.

The NN produces 35 violating traces out of 100 total traces.

Using clustering, we keep 12 counterexamples out of 35 total.

 The retraining time was 1098.35771.

 The re-checking time was 516.08947.

 Counterexamples: After clustering we had 35 counterexamples and after retraining only 2 remained.

 Generalization test: Out of the 100 traces, the new NN has 2.

Iteration 2.

----------------------

 The falsification time was 883.80074.

The NN produces 6 violating traces out of 100 total traces.

Using clustering, we keep 5 counterexamples out of 6 total.

 The retraining time was 15437.25370.

 The re-checking time was 466.46317.

 Counterexamples: After clustering we had 6 counterexamples and after retraining only 0 remained.

 Generalization test: Out of the 100 traces, the new NN has 0.

Iteration 3.

----------------------

 The falsification time was 2799.09973.

The NN produces 1 violating traces out of 100 total traces.

Using clustering, we keep 1 counterexamples out of 1 total.

 The retraining time was 386.37220.

 The re-checking time was 457.51642.

 Counterexamples: After clustering we had 1 counterexamples and after retraining only 1 remained.

 Generalization test: Out of the 100 traces, the new NN has 100.
