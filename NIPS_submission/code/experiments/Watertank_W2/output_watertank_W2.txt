The number of cells per dimension equals 4.

The number of cells in total equals 256.

The resolution of each cell is 1.

The cell occupancy (coverage metric) is 100%.

The time spent for trace generation is 1476.58816.

The time spent for training is 1083.11416.



The STL property for the NN is (alw_[0,sim_time] (((abs(In1[t+dt]-In1[t])>d) or ([t]==0)) => (ev_[0,3.5] (alw_[0,1.5] ((abs(y_nn[t]-In1[t])<e)))))) and ((abs(y_nn[t]-y[t])<0.2)).

The falsification/retraining loop was executed 1 times.

Iteration 1.

----------------------

 The falsification time was 2208.01945.

The nominal produces 92 violating traces out of 100 total traces.

The NN produces 0 violating traces out of 100 total traces.

Before we used sampling-based method for falsification.

 We searched again with optimizaton-based methods as shown below.

The nominal produces 92 violating traces out of 100 total traces.

The NN produces 0 violating traces out of 100 total traces.
