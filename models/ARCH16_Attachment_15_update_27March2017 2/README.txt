Benchmark: Large-Scale Linear Systems from Order-Reduction
Hoang-Dung Tran, Luan Viet Nguyen, and Taylor T. Johnson

Each folder is named for the corresponding benchmark described in the paper.

For some examples, reduced-order models are also presented using the suffix r with the size of the reduced-order model.

The difference to the previous paper attachment submitted to ARCH16 is that more digits of the floating point numbers of the original benchmark are considered.
