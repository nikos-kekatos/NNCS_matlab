Here is one of the "classical" papers on combining controllers ("Switching Between Stabilizing Controllers"). 
The paper nicely states that designing a single controller with multiple performance requirements (noise rejection, fast response) is hard
but it is possible with switching controller, but the switching law should satisfy some condition for stability to be preserved.
See the attached paper, where there is an example at the end that we can use.
