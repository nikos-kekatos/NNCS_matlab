# Approximating a PID controller by a Neural Network

In this work, we intend to mimic the behavior of a PID controller by a feedforward Neural Network.

## Download
Open your terminal, navigate to your desired directory and write:
``git clone git@github.com:nikos-kekatos/NNCS_matlab.git``

## Installation
The code is written in MATLAB and it makes use of Simulink and Deep Learning Toolbox. No special installation is required. The user has to simply navigate to the  `src/` and run the `main_ncss.m`. The files will be automatically added to MATLAB path.

#### More details on tool usage, options, etc. will be provided.
